# Research Focus 
**Topic:** Generative AI with Python
**Objective:** Adding some extra things to the workshop.
# Key Findings & Insights 
**Summary of Research:**
- Included an image interpolation example with the Kandinsky model
- Showed an example of retrieving text through an API, and then sending this to a text-to-speech engine
- Used "random genre creator" code for providing a prompt for the text-to-audio example
Interpolation example:

**New Concepts Learned:**
Learned a bit about image interpolation and how this is influenced by weights and a prompt. The weights and prompt need to have a sum of 1. So you pass along these lists:
```python
["a spacey cat", cat_pic, space_pic]
[0.2, 0.4, 0.4]
```
The Kandinsky model then "digests" them in order to mix the two images. 

My graphics card at home is also not as good as the college ones, so I had to free memory quite a lot. I doubt this will be too much of an issue during the worshops, but it is worth knowing.

# Practical Applications 
**How Can This Be Used in CTH Projects?**
This is going to the new workshop, and it might be something Fotus wants his students to be aware of.
**Next Steps & Future Research**
The final thing I'd like to add is an example of stable diffusion latent animations.

Other things that might be worth thinking about, though I don't deem them high priority at the moment:
- results from using enhanced prompts in image interpolation
- results from changing the weights in image interpolation
# Personal Reflections 
Discovered this guy recently. I need to use more interesting examples in the workshops: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8TM0LKMZff8
