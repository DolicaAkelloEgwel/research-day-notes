# Research Focus 
**Topic:** Generative AI with Python
**Objective:** Adding some extra things to the workshop.
# Key Findings & Insights 
**Summary of Research:**
- Included an image interpolation example with the Kandinsky model
- Showed an example of retrieving text through an API, and then sending this to a text-to-speech engine
- Used "random genre creator" code for providing a prompt for the text-to-audio example
Interpolation example:

**New Concepts Learned:**
Learned a bit about image interpolation and how this is influenced by weights and a prompt. Also have a better understanding of freeing pytorch memory.

# Practical Applications 
**How Can This Be Used in CTH Projects?**
This is going to the new workshop. Also freeing memory in pytorch will be useful for other AP applications.
**Next Steps & Future Research**
The final thing I'd like to add is an example of stable diffusion latent animations.
# Personal Reflections 
Discovered this guy recently. I need to use more interesting examples in the workshops: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8TM0LKMZff8
