**Summary of Research:**
I was curious about exploring the latent space in Stable Diffusion. I found an old-ish [repo](https://github.com/DolicaAkelloEgwel/Stable-Diffusion-Latent-Space-Explorer) that I was able to get up and running in a fork. In doing this, I realised that my Nvidia drivers were quite old. I thought this wouldn't be too much of an issue at first, but I hit a problem where a call in the `transformers` library had been blocked on older versions of the library. Getting around this neccessitated updating transformers, which meant updating torch, which meant updating CUDA.

Random walk looks interesting:

# Practical Applications 
**How Can This Be Used in CTH Projects?**
Will at least include the examples in the Generative AI workshop, but there is already enough material for two hours.
**Next Steps & Future Research**
I think placing this code in a ready-made WSL image that students can download and run might be pretty helpful.
